# SwiftAI

Example of CLI tool using the OpenAIClient library. I only implemented commands for completion and stream-completion.

## How to run

TLDR
```
swift run
alias ai='./.build/arm64-apple-macosx/debug/SwiftAI'
ai completion "write a 5 line poem about spring" --model "text-davinci-002"
ai stream-completion "write a 5 line poem about spring" --model "text-davinci-002"
```

First time youâ€™ll get this instruction to fill-in your credentials.
```
Error: ðŸ‘‰ Please edit the file Sources/SwiftAI/makeClient.swift with your OpenAI credentials.
```

A longer terminal session:
```

I can't wait for the warmer weather
And the days that are longer and brighter
I'm so sick of being cooped up inside
I just want to go outside and have some fun
Spring is finally here, and I couldn't be happier
